/**
 * <p>
 * An immutable class that is used to reduce the rows that are returned for a
 * table. The property is the Bean (Or Map) attribute that will used to reduce
 * the results based on the value. Or, in other words, it is simply the column
 * that the user is trying to filter and the value that they entered.
 * </p>

 * The property can use dot (.) notation to access nested classes. For example
 * if you have an object called President that is composed with another object
 * called Name then your property would be name.firstName
